STRONG NUMBER CHECKER


Project Description:-
This project is a simple Strong Number Checker developed using the C programming language. It checks whether a given number is a strong number by calculating the sum of the factorials of its digits and comparing the result with the original number.

Purpose of the Project:-
The purpose of this project is to check whether a number is a strong number by calculating the sum of the factorials of its digits and comparing it with the original number.

Utility of the Project:-
This project is useful for beginners to understand number manipulation, loops, and mathematical logic in C programming.

Features:-
Accepts a number from the user as input.
Separates each digit of the number.
Calculates the factorial of each digit.
Computes the sum of the factorials of all digits.
Compares the calculated sum with the original number.
Displays whether the given number is a strong number or not.
Simple logic and easy-to-understand program flow.

Future Scope:-
In the future, this project can be enhanced to check strong numbers within a given range instead of a single number. The program can also be optimized for faster factorial calculation and extended with a menu-driven interface to make it more interactive.
